<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Genset Controller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Automatic</li><li>Semi Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automatic Genset Controller market is categorized into two main types: fully automatic and semi-automatic systems. Fully automatic controllers operate independently, managing power outages without human intervention. They monitor power supply and automatically start the generator when needed. In contrast, semi-automatic controllers require some manual oversight; they may alert operators to start the genset but do not handle the entire process autonomously. Both types cater to different operational needs, balancing convenience and user control in power management.</p></p>
