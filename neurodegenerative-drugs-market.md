<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neurodegenerative Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NMDA</li><li>SSRIs</li><li>Dopamine Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neurodegenerative drugs market encompasses various treatment types targeting conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. NMDA receptor antagonists, such as memantine, help regulate glutamate activity, reducing excitotoxicity. SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are used to manage depression associated with neurodegeneration by increasing serotonin levels. Dopamine inhibitors, including drugs like ropinirole, manage symptoms by modulating dopaminergic activity, addressing motor functions and improving quality of life for patients with conditions like Parkinson's. Each type plays a crucial role in therapeutic strategies.</p></p>
