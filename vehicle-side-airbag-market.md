<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Side Airbag Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Side Torso Airbags</li><li>Side Tubular or Curtain Airbags</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle side airbag market includes two main types: side torso airbags and side tubular or curtain airbags. Side torso airbags are designed to protect the upper body of occupants during side-impact collisions by deploying from the side of the seat. In contrast, side tubular or curtain airbags deploy from the roof area and extend down the window, providing head protection and preventing ejection during a rollover. Both types enhance passenger safety by absorbing impact forces and mitigating injuries.</p></p>
